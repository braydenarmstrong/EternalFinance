                <p>The 50/30/20 rule is a simple budgeting method that helps you manage your money in a balanced way. It suggests dividing your income into three categories: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings or debt repayment. The remaining 20% goes toward building savings or paying down debt. This approach helps you prioritize financial stability while still enjoying life, making budgeting less restrictive and more manageable.</p>

                    <p>Budgeting is a powerful tool that helps you take control of your finances by planning where your money goes each month. By creating a budget, you allocate specific amounts to categories like rent, groceries, entertainment, and savings, ensuring that every dollar has a purpose. This intentional approach helps you avoid overspending, prepare for unexpected expenses, and work toward financial goals, like paying off debt or saving for the future. </p>
