                <p>The debt snowball method is a popular strategy for paying off debt by focusing on small victories to build momentum. With this approach, you start 
                    by paying off your smallest debt first, while making minimum payments on the rest. Once the smallest debt is gone, you roll that payment into the 
                    next smallest debt, gradually tackling larger debts as you go. This "snowball" effect helps you stay motivated, as you see progress quickly. 
                    The debt snowball is less about interest rates and more about gaining confidence and momentum as you work toward becoming completely debt-free.</p>
